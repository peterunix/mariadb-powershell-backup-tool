# Automatic MariaDB Incremental Backups with Powershell
## Usage
Edit the script and modify the variables ~DBUSER~ and ~DBPASS~ to be your database credentials.
You can either run the script standalone or schedule it using the Windows Task Manager to have your incremental backups run

#+begin_src powershell
./PS-MariaDBBackupTool.ps1
#+end_src

## Important Note
Only use this with InnoDB.
If you have MyISAM the database wont backup incrementally properly.
It'll work, but each incremental would be the same size as the initial backup.
If you migrated from MyISAM to InnoDB, make sure to remove the MyISAM backups of the database from the mysql folder.
The reason is the same as listed above.
